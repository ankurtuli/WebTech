    <p>I chose Babson because I believe an education is like building a toolkit. I believe Babson, more than any other school, truly provides students with the platform to explore any areas of interest which a student feels will be beneficial to their career. In this sense, I believe Babson prepares students, better than any other school, to go out and create whatever they want. I have ideas every day and when I graduate I plan to use what I've learned to go out and create them. I have always been familiar with the process of developing software, thanks to working wiht my father, and I am excited to put together a team to create new and exciting things with technology.</p>
    <p>My favorite sport has been and probably will always be Basketball. I've always been quite tall for my age, and so I played basketball competitively for several years. My favorite team has always been the Lakers, and I can hardly put into words how exciting it is to have LeBron on our team and to finally be competitive in the NBA. </p>
